	abstract = {The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam’s razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

	abstract = {We present a novel characterization of slow variables for continuous Markov processes that provably preserve the slow timescales. These slow variables are known as reaction coordinates in molecular dynamical applications, where they play a key role in system analysis and coarse graining. The deﬁning characteristics of these slow variables is that they parametrize a so-called transition manifold, a low-dimensional manifold in a certain density function space that emerges with progressive equilibration of the system’s fast variables. The existence of said manifold was previously predicted for certain classes of metastable and slow-fast systems. However, in the original work, the existence of the manifold hinges on the pointwise convergence of the system’s transition density functions towards it. We show in this work that a convergence in average with respect to the system’s stationary measure is suﬃcient to yield reaction coordinates with the same key qualities. This allows one to accurately predict the timescale preservation in systems where the old theory is not applicable or would give overly pessimistic results. Moreover, the new characterization is still constructive, in that it allows for the algorithmic identiﬁcation of a good slow variable. The improved characterization, the error prediction and the variable construction are demonstrated by a small metastable system.},

In this paper, we are interested in deriving effective properties for the dynamics of a coarse-grained variable ξ(x), where x describes the conﬁguration of the system in a high-dimensional space Rn, and ξ is a given smooth function with value in R (typically a reaction coordinate). It is well known that, given a Boltzmann–Gibbs distribution on x ∈ Rn, the equilibrium properties on ξ(x) are completely determined by the free energy. On the other hand, the question of the effective dynamics on ξ(x) is much more difﬁcult to address. Starting from an overdamped Langevin equation on x ∈ Rn, we propose an effective dynamics for ξ(x) ∈ R using conditional expectations. Using entropy methods, we give sufﬁcient conditions for the time marginals of the effective dynamics to be close to the original ones, with precise error bounds. We check numerically on several examples that these sufﬁcient conditions yield an effective dynamics which accurately reproduces the residence times in the potential energy wells. We also discuss the accuracy of the effective dynamics in a pathwise sense, and the relevance of the free energy to build a coarse-grained dynamics.},

For many complex systems, however, although one observes evolution at a macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are only given at a more detailed (ﬁne-scale, microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics). Here, we review a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and length scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form—hence the term equation-free. We selectively discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles and illustrate the approach through representative applications. We also discuss potential difﬁculties and outline areas for future research.},

	abstract = {In global ocean models, the representation of small-scale, high-frequency processes considerably influences the large-scale oceanic circulation and its low-frequency variability. This study investigates the impact of stochastic perturbation schemes based on three different subgrid-scale parameterizations in multidecadal ocean-only simulations with the ocean model NEMO at 1° resolution. The three parameterizations are an enhanced vertical diffusion scheme for unstable stratification, the Gent–McWilliams (GM) scheme, and a turbulent kinetic energy mixing scheme, all commonly used in state-of-the-art ocean models. The focus here is on changes in interannual variability caused by the comparatively high-frequency stochastic perturbations with subseasonal decorrelation time scales. These perturbations lead to significant improvements in the representation of low-frequency variability in the ocean, with the stochastic GM scheme showing the strongest impact. Interannual variability of the Southern Ocean eddy and Eulerian streamfunctions is increased by an order of magnitude and by 20\%, respectively. Interannual sea surface height variability is increased by about 20\%–25\% as well, especially in the Southern Ocean and in the Kuroshio region, consistent with a strong underestimation of interannual variability in the model when compared to reanalysis and altimetry observations. These results suggest that enhancing subgrid-scale variability in ocean models can improve model variability and potentially its response to forcing on much longer time scales, while also providing an estimate of model uncertainty.},

A clustering algorithm in the space of the resolved variables is combined with statistical modelling of the impact of the unresolved variables. The clusters and the parameters of the associated subgrid models are estimated simultaneously from data. The method is implemented and explored in the framework of the Lorenz '96 model using discrete Markov processes as local statistical models. Performance of the cluster-weighted Markov chain scheme is investigated for long-term simulations as well as ensemble prediction. It clearly outperforms simple parametrization schemes and compares favourably with another recently proposed subgrid modelling scheme also based on conditional Markov chains.},

Presently, computer simulations play an increasingly important, if not central, role. Some problems do not require speciﬁc atomistic details, whereas others require them only locally. However, in many cases this strict separation is not sufﬁcient for a comprehensive understanding of systems, and ﬂexible simulation schemes are required that link the different levels of resolution. We here give a general view of the problem regarding soft matter and discuss some speciﬁc examples of linked simulation techniques at different resolution levels.

	abstract = {More and more frequently, computational biomechanics deals with problems where the portion of physical reality to be modeled spans over such a large range of spatial and temporal dimensions, that it is impossible to represent it as a single space–time continuum. We are forced to consider multiple space–time continua, each representing the phenomenon of interest at a characteristic space–time scale. Multiscale models describe a complex process across multiple scales, and account for how quantities transform as we move from one scale to another. This review offers a set of definitions for this emerging field, and provides a brief summary of the most recent developments on multiscale modeling in biomechanics. Of all possible perspectives, we chose that of the modeling intent, which vastly affect the nature and the structure of each research activity. To the purpose we organized all papers reviewed in three categories: ‘causal confirmation,’ where multiscale models are used as materializations of the causation theories; ‘predictive accuracy,’ where multiscale modeling is aimed to improve the predictive accuracy; and ‘determination of effect,’ where multiscale modeling is used to model how a change at one scale manifests in an effect at another radically different space–time scale. Consistent with how the volume of computational biomechanics research is distributed across application targets, we extensively reviewed papers targeting the musculoskeletal and the cardiovascular systems, and covered only a few exemplary papers targeting other organ systems. The review shows a research subdomain still in its infancy, where causal confirmation papers remain the most common.

	abstract = {Modeling and simulation is transforming modern materials science, becoming an important tool for the discovery of new materials and material phenomena, for gaining insight into the processes that govern materials behavior, and, increasingly, for quantitative predictions that can be used as part of a design tool in full partnership with experimental synthesis and characterization. Modeling and simulation is the essential bridge from good science to good engineering, spanning from fundamental understanding of materials behavior to deliberate design of new materials technologies leveraging new properties and processes. This Roadmap presents a broad overview of the extensive impact computational modeling has had in materials science in the past few decades, and offers focused perspectives on where the path forward lies as this rapidly expanding ﬁeld evolves to meet the challenges of the next few decades. The Roadmap offers perspectives on advances within disciplines as diverse as phase ﬁeld methods to model mesoscale behavior and molecular dynamics methods to deduce the fundamental atomic-scale dynamical processes governing materials response, to the challenges involved in the interdisciplinary research that tackles complex materials problems where the governing phenomena span different scales of materials behavior requiring multiscale approaches. The shift from understanding fundamental materials behavior to development of quantitative approaches to explain and predict experimental observations requires advances in the methods and practice in simulations for reproducibility and reliability, and interacting with a computational ecosystem that integrates new theory development, innovative applications, and an increasingly integrated software and computational infrastructure that takes advantage of the increasingly powerful computational methods and computing hardware.},

Although such models are often ‘deterministic’, these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models’ outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model.

	abstract = {Stochastic parametrisations are used in weather and climate models to improve the representation of unpredictable unresolved processes. When compared to a deterministic model, a stochastic model represents ‘model uncertainty’, i.e., sources of error in the forecast due to the limitations of the forecast model. We present a technique for systematically deriving new stochastic parametrisations or for constraining existing stochastic approaches. A high-resolution model simulation is coarse-grained to the desired forecast model resolution. This provides the initial conditions and forcing data needed to drive a Single Column Model (SCM). By comparing the SCM parametrised tendencies with the evolution of the high resolution model, we can estimate the error in the SCM tendencies that a stochastic parametrisation seeks to represent. We use this approach to assess the physical basis of the widely used Stochastically Perturbed Parametrisation Tendencies (SPPT) scheme. We ﬁnd justiﬁcation for the multiplicative nature of SPPT, and for the use of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic perturbations. We ﬁnd evidence that the stochastic perturbation should be positively skewed, indicating that occasional large-magnitude positive perturbations are physically realistic. However other key assumptions of SPPT are less well justiﬁed, including coherency of the stochastic perturbations with height, coherency of the perturbations for different physical parametrisation schemes, and coherency for different prognostic variables. Relaxing these SPPT assumptions allows for an error model that explains a larger fractional variance than traditional SPPT. In particular, we suggest that independently perturbing the tendencies associated with different parametrisation schemes is justiﬁable, and would improve the realism of the SPPT approach.},

The paper proceeds by taking variations in the SVP to derive stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their Itô representation; and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in comparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid models. The circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid models. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic Stratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in incompressible stochastic flows. However, these Stratonovich properties are not apparent in the equivalent Itô representation, because they are disguised by the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the Stratonovich to Itô transformation. This term is a geometric generalization of the quadratic covariation drift term already found for scalar densities in Stratonovich's famous 1966 paper. The paper also derives motion equations for two examples of stochastic geophysical fluid dynamics; namely, the Euler–Boussinesq and quasi-geostropic approximations.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slowchangesof climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” disturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

We hypothesize that this is due to their lack of a “periodic” inductive bias. As a ﬁx of this problem, we propose a new activation, namely, x + sin2(x), which achieves the desired periodic inductive bias to learn a periodic function while maintaining a favorable optimization property of the ReLU-based activations.

	abstract = {Over the last couple of years, machine learning parameterizations have emerged as a potential way to improve the representation of sub-grid processes in Earth System Models (ESMs). So far, all studies were based on the same three-step approach: ﬁrst a training dataset was created from a high-resolution simulation, then a machine learning algorithm was ﬁtted to this dataset, before the trained algorithm was implemented in the ESM. The resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and biases. Here, coupled online learning is proposed as a way to combat these issues. Coupled learning can be seen as a second training stage in which the pretrained machine learning parameterization, speciﬁcally a neural network, is run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation. The high-resolution simulation is kept in sync with the neural network-driven ESM through constant nudging. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the highresolution simulation would produce if it experienced the states the neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz 96 model, where coupled learning is able to recover the "true" parameterizations. Further, detailed algorithms for the implementation of coupled learning in 3D cloud-resolving models and the super parameterization framework are presented. Finally, outstanding challenges and issues not resolved by this approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {Coarse graining of (geophysical) flow problems is a necessity brought upon us by the wide range of spatial and temporal scales present in these problems, which cannot be all represented on a numerical grid without an inordinate amount of computational resources. Traditionally, the effect of the unresolved eddies is approximated by deterministic closure models, i.e. so-called parameterizations. The effect of the unresolved eddy field enters the resolved-scale equations as a forcing term, denoted as the ’eddy forcing’. Instead of creating a deterministic parameterization, our goal is to infer a stochastic, data-driven surrogate model for the eddy forcing from a (limited) set of reference data, with the goal of accurately capturing the long-term flow statistics. Our surrogate modelling approach essentially builds on a resampling strategy, where we create a probability density function of the reference data that is conditional on (time-lagged) resolved-scale variables. The choice of resolved-scale variables, as well as the employed time lag, is essential to the performance of the surrogate. We will demonstrate the effect of different modelling choices on a simplified ocean model of two-dimensional turbulence in a doubly periodic square domain.},

The pertinence of stochasticity is also discussed in the context of the question of how many bits of useful information are contained in the numerical representations of variables, a question that is critical for the design of next-generation climate models.

	abstract = {There has been a recent burst of activity in the atmosphere-ocean sciences community in utilizing stable linear Langevin stochastic models for the unresolved degrees of freedom in stochastic climate prediction. Here a systematic mathematical strategy for stochastic climate modeling is developed, and some of the new phenomena in the resulting equations for the climate variables alone are explored. The new phenomena include the emergence of both unstable linear Langevin stochastic models for the climate mean variables and the need to incorporate both suitable nonlinear effects and multiplicative noise in stochastic models under appropriate circumstances. All of these phenomena are derived from a systematic self-consistent mathematical framework for eliminating the unresolved stochastic modes that is mathematically rigorous in a suitable asymptotic limit. The theory is illustrated for general quadratically nonlinear equations where the explicit nature of the stochastic climate modeling procedure can be elucidated. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated for the truncated equations for barotropic ﬂow with topography. Explicit concrete examples with the new phenomena are presented for the stochastically forced three-mode interaction equations. The conjecture of Smith and Waleffe [Phys. Fluids 11 (1999), 1608–1622] for stochastically forced three-wave resonant equations in a suitable regime of damping and forcing is solved as a byproduct of the approach. Examples of idealized climate models arising from the highly inhomogeneous equilibrium statistical mechanics for geophysical ﬂows are also utilized to demonstrate self-consistency of the mathematical approach with the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, for these examples, the reduced stochastic modeling procedure for the climate variables alone is designed to reproduce both the climate mean and the energy spectrum of the climate variables.},

Unlike related diﬀusion methods, DSDs incorporate information across time scales, which allows for the intrinsic data structure to be inferred in a parameterfree manner. This article develops a theory for DSD based on the multitemporal emergence of mesoscopic equilibria in the underlying diﬀusion process. New algorithms for denoising and dimension reduction with DSD are also proposed and analyzed. These approaches are based on a weighted spectral decomposition of the underlying diﬀusion process, and experiments on synthetic datasets and real biological networks illustrate the eﬃcacy of the proposed algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy. Throughout, comparisons with related methods are made, in order to illustrate the distinct advantages of DSD for datasets exhibiting multiscale structure.},

	abstract = {We propose a multi-resolution convolutional autoencoder (MrCAE) architecture that integrates and leverages three highly successful mathematical architectures: (i) multigrid methods, (ii) convolutional autoencoders and (iii) transfer learning. The method provides an adaptive, hierarchical architecture that capitalizes on a progressive training approach for multiscale spatio-temporal data. This framework allows for inputs across multiple scales: starting from a compact (small number of weights) network architecture and low-resolution data, our network progressively deepens and widens itself in a principled manner to encode new information in the higher resolution data based on its current performance of reconstruction. Basic transfer learning techniques are applied to ensure information learned from previous training steps can be rapidly transferred to the larger network. As a result, the network can dynamically capture diﬀerent scaled features at diﬀerent depths of the network. The performance gains of this adaptive multiscale architecture are illustrated through a sequence of numerical experiments on synthetic examples and real-world spatial-temporal data.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.},

We survey systematic approaches to incorporating physics and domain knowledge into ML models and distill these approaches into broad categories. Through 10 case studies, we show how these approaches have been used successfully for emulating, downscaling, and forecasting weather and climate processes.

Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

            The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in short-term, medium-range, and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers now routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to represent model inadequacy better and to improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed initially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is also extremely promising for reducing long-standing climate biases and is relevant for determining the climate response to external forcing. This article highlights recent developments from different research groups that show that the stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models 1) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate and 2) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of mathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic equations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately simulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics, statistical mechanics, and turbulence is reviewed; its relevance for the climate problem is demonstrated; and future research directions are outlined.},

	abstract = {Different observations of a relation between inputs (``sources"") and outputs (``targets"") are often reported in terms of histograms (discretizations of the source and the target densities). Transporting these densities to each other provides insight regarding the underlying relation. In (forward) uncertainty quantification, one typically studies how the distribution of inputs to a system affects the distribution of the system responses. Here we focus on the identification of the system (the transport map) itself, once the input and output distributions are determined, and suggest a modification of current practice by including data from what we call ``an observation process."" We hypothesize that there exists a smooth manifold underlying the relation; the sources and the targets are then partial observations (possibly projections) of this manifold. Knowledge of such a manifold implies knowledge of the relation, and thus of ``the right"" transport between source and target observations. When the source-target observations are not bijective (when the manifold is not the graph of a function over both observation spaces either because folds over them give rise to density singularities or because it marginalizes over several observables), recovery of the manifold is obscured. Using ideas from attractor reconstruction in dynamical systems, we demonstrate how additional information in the form of short histories of an observation process can help us recover the underlying manifold. The types of additional information employed and the relation to optimal transport based solely on density observations are illustrated and discussed, along with limitations in the recovery of the true underlying relation.},

In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised feature selection, and we demonstrate its use for the task of clustering. We propose a diﬀerentiable loss function which combines the Laplacian score, that favors low frequency features, with a gating mechanism for feature selection. We improve the Laplacian score, by replacing it with a gated variant computed on a subset of features. This subset is obtained using a continuous approximation of Bernoulli variables whose parameters are trained to gate the full feature space. We mathematically motivate the proposed approach, and demonstrate that in the high noise regime, it is crucial to compute the Laplacian on the gated inputs, rather than on the full feature set. Experimental demonstration of the eﬃcacy of the proposed approach and its advantage over current baselines is provided using several real-world examples.},

As one (or more) knobs “turn,” we record (possibly partial) observations of the system response. We demonstrate how such partial and disorganized observation ensembles can be integrated into coherent response surfaces whose dimension and parametrization can be systematically recovered in a data-driven fashion. The approach can be justified through the Whitney and Takens embedding theorems, allowing reconstruction of manifolds/attractors through different types of observations. We demonstrate our approach by organizing unstructured observations of response surfaces, including the reconstruction of a cusp bifurcation surface for hydrogen combustion in a continuous stirred tank reactor.

	abstract = {Systems of coupled dynamical units (e.g., oscillators or neurons) are known to exhibit complex, emergent behaviors that may be simpliﬁed through coarse-graining: a process in which one discovers coarse variables and derives equations for their evolution. Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering “bespoke” coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artiﬁcial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse ﬂow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical ﬁnite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of “effective” parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin–Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.},

Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identiﬁed—to ‘‘emerge from’’—the data mining process. We will ﬁrst validate this ‘‘emergent space’’ reconstruction for time series sampled without space labels in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space ‘‘discovery’’ illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven ‘‘spatial’’ coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.},

	abstract = {A central problem in data analysis is the low dimensional representation of high dimensional data and the concise description of its underlying geometry and density. In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems are the identiﬁcation of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering a family of diffusion maps, deﬁned as the embedding of complex (high dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidean space, via the eigenvectors of suitably deﬁned random walks deﬁned on the given datasets. Assuming that the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability distribution p(x) = e−U(x), we show that as the number of samples goes to inﬁnity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions of a corresponding differential operator deﬁned on the support of the probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the graph lead to different limiting differential operators. Speciﬁcally, the normalized graph Laplacian leads to a backward Fokker–Planck operator with an underlying potential of 2U (x), best suited for spectral clustering. A different anisotropic normalization of the random walk leads to the backward Fokker–Planck operator with the potential U (x), best suited for the analysis of the long time asymptotics of high dimensional stochastic systems governed by a stochastic differential equation with the same potential U (x). Finally, yet another normalization leads to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami (heat) operator on the manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the geometry of the dataset regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.},

	abstract = {The concise representation of complex high dimensional stochastic systems via a few reduced coordinates is an important problem in computational physics, chemistry, and biology. In this paper we use the ﬁrst few eigenfunctions of the backward Fokker–Planck diﬀusion operator as a coarse-grained low dimensional representation for the long-term evolution of a stochastic system and show that they are optimal under a certain mean squared error criterion. We denote the mapping from physical space to these eigenfunctions as the diﬀusion map. While in high dimensional systems these eigenfunctions are diﬃcult to compute numerically by conventional methods such as ﬁnite diﬀerences or ﬁnite elements, we describe a simple computational data-driven method to approximate them from a large set of simulated data. Our method is based on deﬁning an appropriately weighted graph on the set of simulated data and computing the ﬁrst few eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the corresponding random walk matrix on this graph. Thus, our algorithm incorporates the local geometry and density at each point into a global picture that merges data from diﬀerent simulation runs in a natural way. Furthermore, we describe lifting and restriction operators between the diﬀusion map space and the original space. These operators facilitate the description of the coarse-grained dynamics, possibly in the form of a low dimensional eﬀective free energy surface parameterized by the diﬀusion map reduction coordinates. They also enable a systematic exploration of such eﬀective free energy surfaces through the design of additional “intelligently biased” computational experiments. We conclude by demonstrating our method in a few examples.},

Using a sample from a distribution, it approximates the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated Laplace-Beltrami operators. Theoretical bounds on the approximation error are however generally much weaker than the rates that are seen in practice. This paper uses new approaches to improve the error bounds in the model case where the distribution is supported on a hypertorus. For the data sampling (variance) component of the error we make spatially localised compact embedding estimates on certain Hardy spaces; we study the deterministic (bias) component as a perturbation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator’s associated PDE, and apply relevant spectral stability results. Using these approaches, we match long-standing pointwise error bounds for both the spectral data and the norm convergence of the operator discretisation.},

Depending on the averaging regime and the homogenization regime, two strong convergences in the averaging principle of functional law of large numbers type are established. Then we consider the small ﬂuctuations of the system around its average. Nine cases of functional central limit type theorems are obtained. In particular, even though the averaged equation for the original system is the same, the corresponding homogenization limit for the normal deviation can be quite diﬀerent due to the diﬀerence in the interactions between the fast scales and the deviation scales. We provide quite intuitive explanations for each case. Furthermore, sharp rates both for the strong convergences and the functional central limit theorems are obtained, and these convergences are shown to rely only on the regularity of the coeﬃcients of the system with respect to the slow variable, and do not depend on their regularity with respect to the fast variable, which coincide with the intuition since in the limit equations the fast component has been totally averaged or homogenized out.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study model reduction of linear and bilinear quadratic stochastic control problems with parameter uncertainties. Speciﬁcally, we consider slow-fast systems with unknown diﬀusion coeﬃcient and study the convergence of the slow process in the limit of inﬁnite scale separation. The aim of our work is two-fold: Firstly, we want to propose a general framework for averaging and homogenisation of multiscale systems with parametric uncertainties in the drift or in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Secondly, we want to use this framework to quantify the uncertainty in the reduced system by deriving a limit equation that represents a worst-case scenario for any given (possibly path-dependent) quantity of interest. We do so by reformulating the slow-fast system as an optimal control problem in which the unknown parameter plays the role of a control variable that can take values in a closed bounded set. For systems with unknown diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the underlying stochastic control problem admits an interpretation in terms of a stochastic diﬀerential equation driven by a G-Brownian motion. We prove convergence of the slow process with respect to the nonlinear expectation on the probability space induced by the G-Brownian motion. The idea here is to formulate the nonlinear dynamic programming equation of the underlying control problem as a forward-backward stochastic diﬀerential equation in the G-Brownian motion framework (in brief: G-FBSDE), for which convergence can be proved by standard means. We illustrate the theoretical ﬁndings with two simple numerical examples, exploiting the connection between fully nonlinear dynamic programming equations and second-order BSDE (2BSDE): a linear quadratic Gaussian regulator problem and a bilinear multiplicative triad that is a standard benchmark system in turbulence and climate modelling.},

In this way, our approach works well for many high-dimensional examples. We apply this algorithm to the random perturbations of both iterative maps and differential equations.

Noise-induced oscillations excited before a supercritical Hopf bifurcation are examined by means of complex resonances, the reduced Ruelle–Pollicott (RP) resonances, via a numerical application of the reduction approach of the ﬁrst part of this contribution (Chekroun et al. 2019) to model simulations. The oscillations manifest themselves as peaks in the power spectrum which are associated with RP resonances organized along parabolas, as the bifurcation is neared. These resonances and the associated eigenvectors are furthermore well described by the small-noise expansion formulas obtained by Gaspard (2002) and made explicit in the second part of this contribution (Tantet et al. 2019). Beyond the bifurcation, the spectral gap between the imaginary axis and the real part of the leading resonances quantiﬁes the diffusion of phase of the noise-induced oscillations and can be computed from the linearization of the model and from the diffusion matrix of the noise. In this model, the phase diffusion coefﬁcient thus gives a measure of the predictability of oscillatory events representing ENSO. ENSO events being known to be locked to the seasonal cycle, these results should be extended to the non-autonomous case. More generally, the reduction approach theorized in Chekroun et al. (2019), complemented by our understanding of the spectral properties of reference systems such as the stochastic Hopf bifurcation, provides a promising methodology for the analysis of low-frequency variability in high-dimensional stochastic systems.},

	abstract = {A theory of Ruelle–Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential systems is presented. These resonances are deﬁned as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived. These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal’s oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD. It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously deﬁned, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are collected from partial observations in V , is either sufﬁciently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale separation is weak. The companions articles, Part II [114] and Part III [113], deal with further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for providing an unambiguous “signature” of nonlinear oscillations embedded within a stochastic background. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances presented in this contribution, Part III addresses the question of detection and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic system, namely the Cane–Zebiak model of El Niño-Southern Oscillation subject to noise modeling fast atmospheric ﬂuctuations.},

Discretization of the Fokker-Planck operator turns minimization of the object function into a quadratic programming problem on a convex domain, for which well-established solution methods exist.

	abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of timeevolving systems is the prediction of coarse-grained, or macroscopic, quantities. The purpose of this review is twofold: ﬁrst, to describe a number of simple model systems where the coarse-grained or macroscopic behaviour of a system can be explicitly determined from the full, or microscopic, description; and second, to overview some of the emerging algorithmic approaches that have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, macroscopic dynamics. The model problems we describe may be either stochastic or deterministic in both their microscopic and macroscopic behaviour, leading to four possibilities in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic descriptions. Model problems are given which illustrate all four situations, and mathematical tools for their study are introduced. These model problems are useful in the evaluation of algorithms. We use speciﬁc instances of the model problems to illustrate these algorithms. As the subject of algorithm development and analysis is, in many cases, in its infancy, the primary purpose here is to attempt to unify some of the emerging ideas so that individuals new to the ﬁeld have a structured access to the literature. Furthermore, by discussing the algorithms in the context of the model problems, a platform for understanding existing algorithms and developing new ones is built.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing technologies have made available an ever-increasing amount of ancient genomic data. In particular, it is now possible to target speciﬁc single nucleotide polymorphisms in several samples at different time points. Such timeseries data are also available in the context of experimental or viral evolution. Time-series data should allow for a more precise inference of population genetic parameters and to test hypotheses about the recent action of natural selection. In this manuscript, we develop a likelihood method to jointly estimate the selection coefﬁcient and the age of an allele from time-serial data. Our method can be used for allele frequencies sampled from a single diallelic locus. The transition probabilities are calculated by approximating the standard diffusion equation of the Wright–Fisher model with a one-step process. We show that our method produces unbiased estimates. The accuracy of the method is tested via simulations. Finally, the utility of the method is illustrated with an application to several loci encoding coat color in horses, a pattern that has previously been linked with domestication. Importantly, given our ability to estimate the age of the allele, it is possible to gain traction on the important problem of distinguishing selection on new mutations from selection on standing variation. In this coat color example for instance, we estimate the age of this allele, which is found to predate domestication.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of population-level allele frequency data across one or more related populations necessitates the development of methods that can efficiently estimate population genetics parameters, such as the strength of selection acting on the population(s), from such data. Existing methods for this problem in the setting of the Wright-Fisher diffusion model are primarily likelihood-based, and rely on numerical approximation for likelihood computation and on bootstrapping for assessment of variability in the resulting estimates, requiring extensive computation. Recent work has provided a method for obtaining exact samples from general Wright-Fisher diffusion processes, enabling the development of methods for Bayesian estimation in this setting. We develop and implement a Bayesian method for estimating the strength of selection based on the Wright-Fisher diffusion for data sampled at a single time point. The method utilizes the latest algorithms for exact sampling to devise a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to draw samples from the joint posterior distribution of the selection coefficient and the allele frequencies. We demonstrate that when assumptions about the initial allele frequencies are accurate the method performs well for both simulated data and for an empirical data set on hypoxia in flies, where we find evidence for strong positive selection in a region of chromosome 2L previously identified. We discuss possible extensions of our method to the more general settings commonly encountered in practice, highlighting the advantages of Bayesian approaches to inference in this setting.},

	abstract = {The joint and accurate inference of selection and demography from genetic data is considered a particularly challenging question in population genetics, since both process may lead to very similar patterns of genetic diversity. However, additional information for disentangling these effects may be obtained by observing changes in allele frequencies over multiple time points. Such data are common in experimental evolution studies, as well as in the comparison of ancient and contemporary samples. Leveraging this information, however, has been computationally challenging, particularly when considering multilocus data sets. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel, discrete approximation for diffusion processes, termed mean transition time approximation, which preserves the long-term behavior of the underlying continuous diffusion process. We then derive this approximation for the particular case of inferring selection and demography from time series data under the classic Wright–Fisher model and demonstrate that our approximation is well suited to describe allele trajectories through time, even when only a few states are used. We then develop a Bayesian inference approach to jointly infer the population size and locus-speciﬁc selection coefﬁcients with high accuracy and further extend this model to also infer the rates of sequencing errors and mutations. We ﬁnally apply our approach to recent experimental data on the evolution of drug resistance in inﬂuenza virus, identifying likely targets of selection and ﬁnding evidence for much larger viral population sizes than previously reported.},

	abstract = {Multi-time-scale stochastic dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, and the reduction of such systems and their models to only their slow components is often essential for scientiﬁc computation and further analysis. Rather than being available in the form of an explicit analytical model, often such systems can only be observed as a data set which embodies dynamics on several time scales. We focus on applying and adapting data-mining and manifold learning techniques to detect the slow components in a class of such multiscale data. Traditional data-mining methods are based on metrics (and thus, geometries) which are not informed of the multiscale nature of the underlying system dynamics; such methods cannot successfully recover the slow variables. Here, we present an approach which utilizes both the local geometry and the local noise dynamics within the data set through a metric which is both insensitive to the fast variables and more general than simple statistical averaging. Our analysis of the approach provides conditions for successfully recovering the underlying slow variables, as well as an empirical protocol guiding the selection of the method parameters. Interestingly, the recovered underlying variables are gauge invariant—they are insensitive to the measuring instrument/observation function.},

Depending on the dynamics of the reduced system, the results cover time spans which can be exponentially long in the noise intensity squared (that is, up to Kramers’ time). We obtain exponentially small upper and lower bounds on the probability of exceptional paths. If the slow manifold contains bifurcation points, we show similar concentration properties for the fast variables corresponding to non-bifurcating modes. We also give conditions under which the system can be approximated by a lower-dimensional one, in which the fast variables contain only bifurcating modes.},
